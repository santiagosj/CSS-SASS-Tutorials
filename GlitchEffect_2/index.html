          <h1>Spirits Of The Dead</h1>
          Thy soul shall find itself alone
         'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone;
          Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
          Into thine hour of secrecy.
        </div>
         <br>
        <div class="content">
          Be silent in that solitude,
          Which is not loneliness- for then
          The spirits of the dead, who stood
          In life before thee, are again
          In death around thee, and their will
          Shall overshadow thee; be still.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="content">
          The night, though clear, shall frown,
          And the stars shall not look down
          From their high thrones in the Heaven
          With light like hope to mortals given,
          But their red orbs, without beam,
          To thy weariness shall seem
          As a burning and a fever
          Which would cling to thee for ever.
        </div>
         <br>
        <div class="content">
          Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish,
          Now are visions ne'er to vanish;
          From thy spirit shall they pass
          No more, like dew-drop from the grass.
        </div>
          <br>
        <div class="content">
         The breeze, the breath of God, is still,
         And the mist upon the hill
         Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,
         Is a symbol and a token.
         How it hangs upon the trees,
         A mystery of mysteries!
